# Reproducibility

The scripts in `scripts/` were used to generate the raw MPS-based TEBD data reported in https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23618. These raw datasets are several gigabytes in size and are therefore not included in this repository.

Convergence checks for all TEBD data, including bond-dimension and time-step convergence, were performed as described in the manuscript.

The `scripts/` directory also contains code used for simulations of the effective model discussed in the paper.

The raw data and the post-processing scripts used to generate the figures are available from the authors upon reasonable request.
